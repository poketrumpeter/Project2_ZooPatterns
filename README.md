# Project2_ZooPatterns

###Group Member Names: Gregorio Figueroa, Darrien Lee

Continuation of OOAD project 1 which implements patterns into the design and adds parts of the zoo, as well as adding UML diagrams for this updated zoo program.


Assumptions: As far as assumptions go there are not any in particular and followed the instructions provided.

Issues: We didn't encounter any issues during development. Drawing UML diagrams took quite a bit of time, however.

Special Instructions: For running the program, there will be a time for you to enter a number. Beyond this, don't be alarmed with there not being much console output as it will all be output into a file entitled dayatthezoo.output.
